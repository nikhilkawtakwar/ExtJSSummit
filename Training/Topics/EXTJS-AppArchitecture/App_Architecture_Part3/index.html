    <p>In the previous series of articles <a href="#!/guide/mvc_pt1">Part 1</a>
        and
        <a href="#!/guide/mvc_pt2">Part 2</a>, we explored architecting a
        Pandora-style application using the new features of Ext JS 4. We started
        by
        applying the Model-View-Controller architecture to a complex UI that has
        multiple views, stores and models. We looked at the basic techniques of
        architecting your application, like controlling your views from
        Controllers,
        and firing application-wide events that controllers can listen to. In
        this
        part of the series, we will continue implementing controller logic
        inside of
        the application’s MVC architecture.</p>

    <h3

    </h3>

    <p>Before we continue implementing our application, we should review some of
        the
        more advanced functionality available in the Ext JS 4 MVC package. In
        the
        previous part of this series, we showed how you could automatically load
        <strong>stores</strong> and <strong>models</strong> in your application
        by
        adding them to the stores and models arrays in your <a
                href="#!/api/Ext-method-application"
                rel="Ext-method-application"
                class="docClass">Ext.application</a> configuration. We also
        explained that an instance would be created for each store loaded in
        this
        way, giving it a storeId equal to its name.</p>

    <h3><code>app/Application.js</code></h3>
       
       <pre id="ext-gen3269" class="code"><code id="ext-gen3270"><a
               href="#!/api/Ext-method-application" rel="Ext-method-application"
               class="docClass"><span class="typ">Ext</span><span
               class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">application</span></a><span
               class="pun">({</span><span class="pln">
           </span><span class="pun">...</span><span class="pln">
           models</span><span class="pun">:</span><span
               class="pln"> </span><span
               class="pun">[</span><span class="str">'Station'</span><span
               class="pun">,</span><span
               class="pln"> </span><span class="str">'Song'</span><span
               class="pun">],</span><span class="pln">
           stores</span><span class="pun">:</span><span
               class="pln"> </span><span
               class="pun">[</span><span class="str">'Stations'</span><span
               class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="str">'RecentSongs'</span><span
               class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="str">'SearchResults'</span><span
               class="pun">]</span><span class="pln">
           </span><span class="pun">...</span><span class="pln">
       </span><span class="pun">});</span></code></pre>

    <p>In addition to loading and instantiating these classes, adding stores and
        models into these arrays also automatically creates getters for you.
        This is
        also the case for controllers and views. The stores, models, controllers
        and
        views configurations also exist in Controllers and work exactly the same
        way
        as they do in the Application instance. This means that in order to get
        a
        reference to the Stations store inside of the Station controller, all we
        need to do is add the store to the stores array.</p>

    <h3><code>app/controller/Station.js</code></h3>
       
       <pre id="ext-gen3271" class="code"><code id="ext-gen3272"><span
               class="pun">...</span><span class="pln">
       stores</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> </span><span
               class="pun">[</span><span class="str">'Stations'</span><span
               class="pun">],</span><span class="pln">
       </span><span class="pun">...</span></code></pre>

    <p>Now we can get a reference to the Stations store from anywhere in the
        controller using the automatically generated getter named <code>getStationsStore</code>.
        The convention is straightforward and predictable:</p>
       
       <pre id="ext-gen3273" class="code"><code id="ext-gen3274"><span
               class="pln">views</span><span class="pun">:</span><span
               class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">[</span><span class="str">'StationsList'</span><span
               class="pun">]</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="com">// creates getter named 'getStationsListView' -&gt; returns reference to StationsList class</span><span
               class="pln">

               class="pun">[</span><span class="str">'Station'</span><span
               class="pun">]</span><span
               class="pln">     </span><span class="com">// creates getter named 'getStationModel'     -&gt; returns reference to Station model class</span><span
               class="pln">
       controllers</span><span class="pun">:</span><span
               class="pln"> </span><span
               class="pun">[</span><span class="str">'Song'</span><span
               class="pun">]</span><span class="pln">   </span><span
               class="com">// creates getter named 'getSongController'   -&gt; returns the Song controller instance</span><span
               class="pln">
       stores</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> </span><span
               class="pun">[</span><span class="str">'Stations'</span><span
               class="pun">]</span><span class="pln">    </span><span
               class="com">// creates getter named 'getStationsStore'    -&gt; returns the Stations store instance</span></code></pre>

    <p>It’s important to note that the getters for both views and models return
        a
        reference to the class (requiring you to instantiate your own
        instances),
        while the getters for stores and controllers return actual
        instances.</p>

<article>
    <h3
            class="topic"><a name="mvc_pt3-section-2">Referencing view
        instances</a>
    </h3>


    <p>In the previous section, we described how the stores, models, controllers
        and
        views configurations automatically create getters allowing you to easily
        retrieve references to them. The <code>getStationsListView</code> getter
        will return a reference to the view class. In our application flow, we
        would
        like to select the first item in our StationsList. In this case, we
        don’t
        want a reference to the view class; instead, we want a reference to the
        actual StationsList instance that is inside our viewport.</p>

    <p>In Ext JS 3, a very common approach to getting a reference to an existing
        component instance on the page was the <a
                href="#!/api/Ext-method-getCmp"
                rel="Ext-method-getCmp"
                class="docClass">Ext.getCmp</a>
        method. While this method continues to work, it’s not the recommended
        method
        in Ext JS 4. Using <a href="#!/api/Ext-method-getCmp"
                              rel="Ext-method-getCmp"
                              class="docClass">Ext.getCmp</a> requires you to
        give
        every component a unique ID in order to reference it in your
        application. In
        the new MVC package, we can put a reference to a view instance
        (component)
        inside of a controller by leveraging a new feature in Ext JS 4: <a
                href="#!/api/Ext.ComponentQuery" rel="Ext.ComponentQuery"
                class="docClass">ComponentQuery</a>.</p>

    <h3><code>app/controller/Station.js</code></h3>
       
       <pre id="ext-gen3275" class="code"><code id="ext-gen3276"><span
               class="pun">...</span><span class="pln">
       refs</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> </span><span
               class="pun">[{</span><span class="pln">
           </span><span class="com">// A component query</span><span
               class="pln">
           selector</span><span class="pun">:</span><span
               class="pln"> </span><span
               class="str">'viewport &gt; #west-region &gt; stationslist'</span><span
               class="pun">,</span><span class="pln">
           </span><span class="kwd">ref</span><span class="pun">:</span><span
               class="pln"> </span><span class="str">'stationsList'</span><span
               class="pln">
       </span><span class="pun">}]</span><span class="pln">
       </span><span class="pun">...</span></code></pre>

    <p>In the <code>refs</code> configuration, you can set up references to view
        instances. This allows you to retrieve and manipulate components on the
        page
        inside of your controller’s actions. To describe the component that you
        want
        to reference, you can use a ComponentQuery inside the selector property.
        The
        other required information inside of this object is the <code>ref</code>
        property. This will be used as part of the name of the getter that will
        be
        generated automatically for each item inside the refs array. For
        example, by
        defining <code>ref: 'stationsList'</code> (note the capital L), a getter
        will be generated on the controller called <code>getStationsList</code>.
        Alternatively, if you did not set up a reference inside your controller,
        you
        could continue to use <code><a href="#!/api/Ext-method-getCmp"
                                       rel="Ext-method-getCmp" class="docClass">Ext.getCmp</a></code>
        inside of the controller actions. However, we discourage you from doing
        this
        because it forces you to manage unique component ID's in your project,
        often
        leading to problems as your project grows.</p>

    <p>It’s important to remember that these getters will be created independent
        of
        whether the view actually exists on the page. When you call the getter
        and
        the selector successfully matches a component on the page, it caches the
        result so that subsequent calls to the getter will be fast. However,
        when
        the selector doesn’t match any views on the page, the getter will return
        null. This means that if you have logic that depends on a view and there
        is
        a possibility that the view does not exist on the page yet, you need to
        add
        a check around your logic to ensure it only executes if the getter
        returned
        a result. In addition, if multiple components match the selector, only
        the
        first one will be returned. Thus, it’s good practice to make your
        selectors
        specific to the single view you wish to get. Lastly, when you destroy a
        component you are referencing, calls to the getter will start returning
        null
        again until there is another component matching the selector on the
        page.</p>

<h3
        class="topic"><a name="mvc_pt3-section-3">Cascading your controller
    logic on application
    launch.</a>
</h3>

<p>When the application starts, we want to load the user’s existing stations.
    While you could put this logic inside of the application’s
    <code>onReady</code> method, the MVC architecture provides you with an
    <code>onLaunch</code> method which fires on each controller as soon as all
    the controllers, models and stores are instantiated, and your initial views
    are rendered. This provides you with a clean separation between global
    application logic and logic specific to a controller.</p>

<h3>Step 1</h3>

<h3><code>app/controller/Station.js</code></h3>
       
       <pre id="ext-gen3277" class="code"><code id="ext-gen3278"><span
               class="pun">...</span><span class="pln">
       onLaunch</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> </span><span
               class="kwd">function</span><span class="pun">()</span><span
               class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">{</span><span class="pln">
           </span><span class="com">// Use the automatically generated getter to get the store</span><span
               class="pln">
           </span><span class="kwd">var</span><span
               class="pln"> stationsStore </span><span class="pun">=</span><span
               class="pln"> </span><span class="kwd">this</span><span
               class="pun">.</span><span
               class="pln">getStationsStore</span><span
               class="pun">();</span><span class="pln">
           stationsStore</span><span class="pun">.</span><span
               class="pln">load</span><span class="pun">({</span><span
               class="pln">
               callback</span><span class="pun">:</span><span
               class="pln"> </span><span
               class="kwd">this</span><span class="pun">.</span><span
               class="pln">onStationsLoad</span><span
               class="pun">,</span><span class="pln">
               scope</span><span class="pun">:</span><span
               class="pln"> </span><span
               class="kwd">this</span><span class="pln">
           </span><span class="pun">});</span><span class="pln">
       </span><span class="pun">}</span><span class="pln">
       </span><span class="pun">...</span></code></pre>

<p>The onLaunch method of the Station controller seems like the perfect place to
    call the Station store’s load method. As you can see, we have also set up a
    callback which gets executed as soon as our store is loaded.</p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>

<h3><code>app/controller/Station.js</code></h3>
       
       <pre id="ext-gen3279" class="code"><code id="ext-gen3280"><span
               class="pun">...</span><span class="pln">
       onStationsLoad</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> </span><span
               class="kwd">function</span><span class="pun">()</span><span
               class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">{</span><span class="pln">
           </span><span class="kwd">var</span><span
               class="pln"> stationsList </span><span class="pun">=</span><span
               class="pln"> </span><span class="kwd">this</span><span
               class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">getStationsList</span><span
               class="pun">();</span><span class="pln">
           stationsList</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">getSelectionModel</span><span
               class="pun">().</span><span class="kwd">select</span><span
               class="pun">(</span><span class="lit">0</span><span
               class="pun">);</span><span class="pln">
       </span><span class="pun">}</span><span class="pln">
       </span><span class="pun">...</span></code></pre>

<p>In this callback we get the StationsList instance using the automatically
    generated getter, and select the first item. This will trigger a <code>selectionchange</code>
    event on the StationsList.</p>

<h3>Step 3</h3>

<h3><code>app/controller/Station.js</code></h3>
       
       <pre id="ext-gen3281" class="code"><code id="ext-gen3282"><span

<p>Application events are extremely useful when you have many controllers in
    your application that are interested in an event. Instead of listening for
    the same view event in each of these controllers, only one controller will
    listen for the view event and fire an application-wide event that the others
    can listen for. This also allows controllers to communicate to one another
    without knowing about or depending on each other’s existence. In the <code>onStationSelect</code>
    action, we fire an application event called <code>stationstart</code>.</p>

<p>As part of the init method of the Song controller, we have set up a listener
    to the <code>stationstart</code> application event. When this happens, we
    need to load the songs for this station into our RecentSongs store. We do
    this in the <code>onStationStart</code> method. We get a reference to the
    RecentSongs store and call the load method on it, defining the controller
    action that needs to get fired as soon as the loading has finished.</p>

<h3>Step 5</h3>

<h3><code>app/controller/Song.js</code></h3>

       </span><span class="pun">}</span><span class="pln">
       </span><span class="pun">...</span></code></pre>

<p>When the songs for the station are loaded into the RecentSongs store, we
    select the last song in the RecentlyPlayedScroller. We do this by getting
    the selection model on the RecentlyPlayedScroller <code>dataview</code> and
    calling the select method on it, passing the last record in the RecentSongs
    store.</p>

<p>When we select the last song in the scroller, it will fire a <code>selectionchange</code>
    event. In the control method, we already set up a listener for this event;
    and in the onSongSelect method, we complete the application flow by updating
    the data in the SongInfo view.</p>

    </h3>

    <p>We have illustrated that by using some advanced controller techniques and
        keeping your logic separate from your views, the application’s
        architecture
        becomes easier to understand and maintain. At this stage, the
        application is
        already quite functional. We can search for and add new stations, and we
        can
        start stations by selecting them. Songs for the station will be loaded,
        and
        we show the song and artist information.</p>

    <p>We will continue to refine our application in the next part of this
        series,
        with the focus on styling and custom component creation.</p>
